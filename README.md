# React Frameworks Assignment

## Overview
In this assignment, I created multiple small applications using different React frameworks to understand their structure, setup process, and development workflow. The frameworks I used are **Next.js**, **Remix (React Router)**, **Gatsby**, and **Expo**. Each app is kept simple and focuses on basic functionality as required.

---

## Project Structure
All projects are organized inside one main folder:

react-frameworks-assignment/
├─ next-app
├─ remix-app
├─ my-gatsby-site
├─ expo-app
└─ README.md


Each folder is a separate application with its own `package.json`.

---

## Next.js Application
**Purpose:**  
This app demonstrates a simple landing page using the Next.js App Router.

**What it does:**  
- Displays a header, sections with placeholder text, and a footer.
- Uses server-side rendering by default.

**How to run:**
```bash
cd next-app
npm run dev
Open: http://localhost:3000

Remix Application (React Router)
Purpose:
This app demonstrates Remix-style routing using the official React Router setup.

What it does:

Displays a simple homepage route.

Shows how Remix handles routes and layouts.

How to run:

cd remix-app
npm run dev
Open: http://localhost:3000

Gatsby Application
Purpose:
This app demonstrates a basic Gatsby static site.

What it does:

Displays a simple homepage.

Uses Gatsby’s static site generation.

No CMS or plugins were added to keep it simple.

How to run:

cd my-gatsby-site
npm run develop
Open: http://localhost:8000

Expo Application
Purpose:
This app demonstrates a basic mobile-style application using Expo.

What it does:

Includes two tabs: Home and About.

Runs in the browser or Expo Go app.

How to run:

cd expo-app
npx expo start
Follow the instructions in the terminal to open in browser or Expo Go.

What I Learned
From this assignment, I learned how different React frameworks:

Handle routing differently

Use different development servers

Support web vs mobile development

Require different setup and run commands

This helped me understand when and why each framework would be used in real projects.
